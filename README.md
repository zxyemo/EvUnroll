# EvUnroll

This repo contains the dataset for [**EvUnroll: Neuromorphic events based rolling shutter image correction**](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/Zhou_CVPR22a.pdf)  by Xinyu Zhou, Peiqi Duan, Yi Ma, and [Boxin Shi](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/People.htm).

## Examples of RS correction results on Gev-RS dataset

## Dataset
+ **Gev-RS dataset:**  We capture GS frames from a high-speed camera, and simulate RS frames and corresponding event stream (by [V2E](https://github.com/SensorsINI/v2e)). You can download the dataset from: [[BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pPOZvUPvbRshckVUbxGcJQ)][code: evun]. 
+ **Real-captured dataset:**  We collect a real testing dataset with an RS-event hybrid camera, you can download it from: [[BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DojaY-iwRPiIeHQT98YEUA)][code: evun]

## License
The datasets can be freely used for research and education only. Any commercial use is strictly prohibited.
